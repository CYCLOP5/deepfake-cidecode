# deepfake-cidecode

This project incorporates and builds upon the foundational concepts of the MRI-GAN model for DeepFake detection, originally proposed by Pratikkumar Prajapati and Chris Pollett. While inspired by their work, we have adapted and modified aspects of the implementation to enhance its functionality and optimize it for our specific use case.
